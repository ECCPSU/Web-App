Due: Next Meeting

Create a function (possibly in a different file) that will add two users to the TeamConnection DB.
So the function can be something like "create_alliance(u1, u2)." Be mindful that when doing "foo(u1, u2)," that
isn't necessarily the same as "foo(u2, u1)." If you want to make the function do both at the same time, it can be
done but will take up double the space.

Modify the app file to be able to query the TeamConnection DB and return to the user his/her team.
(look at how the data to the viewteam template is being sent in and see how you can get something like that from the DB)
Feel free to change how the data is actually input to the template as well...
	If you aren't deciding to do the two-in-one aspect, you will need to query the db so that it will handle 'u1, u2' AND 'u2, u1.'
	In other words, you want to find a way to eliminate the overlap between permutations and just have combinations.

To test if the new and revised viewteam page is working, add some teammates to the DB and see what it returns. For example,
to make a team of u1=John, u2=Alex, and u3=Mary, do "foo(u1, u2)" then "foo(u1, u3)" then "foo(u2, u3)."
