Due: Next Meeting

Look at the "things left to implement" file on the google drive inside the tech folder.

Pick an area that you would like to work on/work on with someone else.

Post your choice into the slack #technology chat.

Do some work on your area and be ready to share what you've done at the next meeting (you
dont necessarily have to finish it, but have meaningful progress).
